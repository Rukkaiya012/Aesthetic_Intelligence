For this sprint I gained experience on how to build an adaptive behavior-based UI, which reacts according to the users patterns in real time. I designed a clean tracking engine, pattern detector and layout engine to adjust the UI according to hover, dwell, scroll and repetition signals. Working on integrating the Core sync stub and also putting together a handover package that could be handed over to integrators were particularly beneficial in increasing my knowledge on how real projects transition between prototype phase to integration phase. The micro animations and layout polish also leveled up my design aesthetic.
